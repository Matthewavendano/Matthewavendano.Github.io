## Favorite CPSC 120L labs

Lab 1
I thoroughly enjoyed my lab 1 project because it introduced me to the basics of coding for the first time. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience as it taught me the fundamentals of programming. I appreciated how the project allowed me to apply what I learned in class and see real-world results. Overall, this project was a great learning opportunity that sparked my interest in coding.

Lab 2
I thoroughly enjoyed my lab 2 project, which allowed me to gain hands on experience with coding and learn the basics of declaring string variables. Through this project, I was able to understand the fundamental concepts of coding and how to apply them in a practical way. The project was not only informative but also fun, as it challenged me to think creatively and experiment with different coding techniques. Overall, I found the experience to be engaging and rewarding, and I'm excited to continue building on my coding skills in future projects.

lab 12
I truly enjoyed working on my lab 12 project because it involved coding to manipulate the three color channels of an image red, green, and blue. It was fascinating to see how altering each channel individually affected the overall appearance of the image. Through this project, I gained a better understanding of animation techniques and how changing colors can create dynamic visual effects. Overall, this project was both educational and rewarding, allowing me to explore the creative possibilities of coding and image manipulation.
